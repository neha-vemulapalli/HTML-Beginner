              A big part of my life since I was little has been music. I have
              played piano from when I was around 7 all the up to 15 years old.
              I also recently learned how to play the guitar during my senior
              year of highschool.
              <br />
              I listen to music every day and it ranges from current pop music
              to r&b or 80s/90s music.

              Another activity that I have grown to love is dance. I have danced
              competitevly from the age of 5 up to 13. Afterwards, I just danced
              for fun with family and friends during special events.

              Another hobby that I recently gotten into with a class in my last
              year of high school is pottery. I made functional dishes such as
              vases, a mug, a bowl, and a box.

              Throughout high school I have become heavily involved in

              through NHS. Though, the program that I have gotten my most hours
              (almost 100) from was ENGin. My main focus was to help people from
              Ukraine that were my age to practice and improve their English
              speaking skills.
