            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>A big part of my life since I was little has been music. I have
              played piano from when I was around 7 all the up to 15 years old.
              I also recently learned how to play the guitar during my senior
              year of highschool. I listen to music every day and it ranges from current pop music
              to r&b or 80s/90s music.<p>
